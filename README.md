# Heroes-Of-Torn-Server
This is the server side of the Heroes Of Torn multiplayer strategy game. It is a c# console app and acts a multi threaded tcp socket server, receiving commands from the client, processing the command and replying appropriately


This was developed prior to my education at Blackpool and The Fylde College (accredited by Lancaster University) and was built to facilitate  a multiplayer collectable turn based strategy game which I had developed in Unity3d.
